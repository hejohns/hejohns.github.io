## About
I'm Johnson He.

My screen name is *hejohns*.

## Code
- [Gradescope-Utils](https://github.com/eecs490/gradescope-utils), a suite of scripts for EECS 490 grading, but also CSV, JSON, manipulation more broadly
- [misc command line utilities](https://github.com/hejohns/.rc/tree/master/home/bin).
    `colorless` is nice for long `git status` output (it's really color-less).
