This evening, I made my largest single import of books to date.
A certain logician is moving to another university-- upwards in the academic food chain--
and offered up some of their books for grabs.
I thought I should catalogue the lot, both for my own sake, and as a way to increase their utilization.
Personal libraries are great, but something is quite sad when you think about a book's realized reading time v. how often it just sits on the shelf.
Or in my case, a box.

Extending this to my current collection, the below is a best effort catalogue of what I have.
Any listing is loanable-- just ask.

Each section is roughly in decreasing order of rank, which is an opaque combination of whether I've read it, enjoyment, perceived reputation/reverence/significance, etc.
