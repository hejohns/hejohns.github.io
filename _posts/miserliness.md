To keep track of funny sayings I've come across:

(most are inevitably heavily distorted, owing to my poor recall.
Best attempt at attribution.)

- miserliness is the surest sign of general unhappiness[^1]
- you may bark, or not bark, but as part of the pack you *must* wag your tail[^2]
- TODO: (Quine's thing about infinite cardinals, in the P-G edit)
- "I was send off to Tokyo in a taxi, lest I do damage to my leg--
this at Chūō Kōron expense, though I shall insist upon re-paying.
The tariff I set down for the record, since I shall probably never again have such a long taxi ride: ¥5,540. Very cheap, I say-- less than a day of Mr. Hertz.[^4]
- "This last fact perhaps helps to confirm a theory I have long had,
that the novel got out of hand,
that Tanizaki did not really want Taeko to be so likeable."[^5]

[^1]: Kafka, English tr
[^2]: Chekhov, English tr
[^4]: E. Seidensticker
[^5]: *ibid*. After referring to the real life inspiration of Taeko as "coarse and vulgar".
