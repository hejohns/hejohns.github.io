To keep track of funny sayings I've come across:

(most are inevitably heavily distorted, owing to my poor recall.
Best attempt at attribution.)

- miserliness is the surest sign of general unhappiness (Kafka, English tr)
- you may bark, or not bark, but as part of the pack you *must* wag your tail (Chekhov, English tr)
- (Quine's thing about infinite cardinals, in the P-G edit)
