Instead of doing work, I got to thinking that since I spend so much time in vim,
I should really build and configure vim from source,
instead of just using the debian packaged vim-gtk3.

Also I should really contribute a little to vim over time.
The only thing I've contributed back was a bug report about unicode character handling,
which someone patched and Bram merged within a couple days(!).

So let's keep a [fork](https://github.com/hejohns/vim) to track my config.
