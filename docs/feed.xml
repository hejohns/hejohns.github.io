in the sense of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3219">Awodey</a>.
And I still have yet to read most of the paper,
but I’d always thought that that paper must’ve been about, well, natural models.
But as far as I can tell, the paper is not about models of homotopy type theory
in a model of homotopy type theory.</p>

<p>(I first wrote “<em>the</em> intended model” instead of “a model”, but afaik there is no intended model of homotopy type theory– or many type theories– anyways, at least not in the sense which will be described below.)</p>

<p>You see, at the end of Enderton’s undergraduate set theory book,
he has a small section on <em>natural models</em> of set theory.
A natural model is \(V_α ⊆ V\)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, that is closed under the set theory axioms.
For example, a natural model of \(Z\)
(ie \(ZF∖\{\) replacement \(\}\), as per Enderton)
is some capped off \(V_α\) that is closed under pairing, union, powersets, etc.</p>

<p>So you can go though each axiom and check off that \(V_ω\) is almost a model
of \(Z\), but actually \(α\) needs to be a limit ordinal (powerset axiom) above \(ω\) (infinity axiom), so the smallest \(α\) is \(2ω\).</p>

<p>Then Enderton shows that \(V_{2ω} ̸⊧ ZF\), thus it must not satisfy replacement.
But assuming an inaccessible cardinal \(κ\), \(V_κ ⊧ ZF\) (ie the replacement axioms are satisfied as well).</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is the canonical proof that replacement is independent of \(Z\), but it’s a nice one,
and when I read this section of Enderton,
it cemented itself as one the all time best things I’d ever read.</p>

<p>To be precise, I should clarify that these results show that
\(V_{2ω} ⊧ Z\) but \(V_{2ω} ̸⊧ ZF\), ie \(V_{2ω} ̸⊧ Z + \text{replacement}\),
thus \(Z ̸⊧ \text{replacement}\), thus \(Z ̸⊢ \text{replacement}\).
And \(Z ̸⊢ ¬\text{replacement}\)<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, since \(Z ̸⊧ ¬\text{replacement}\),
since \(V_κ ⊧ Z + \text{replacement}\).</p>

<p>Thus replacement is independent of \(Z\), ie \(ZF\) is strictly stronger than \(Z\).
Now, one would ask about \(ZF\) and \(ZFC\)!</p>

<p>I don’t think Enderton makes comment on it in the small section on natural models.
I would think that choice only gives you sets of smaller rank, so any \(V_α\) is closed under choice? Or at least for nontrivial \(α\)?
I think I’ve seen that somewhere, but if I’m horribly wrong I’ll be quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>In any case, \(V_κ\) should be a model of \(ZFC\) then,
which means that Gödel’s famous half of the independence of choice
presumably doesn’t require inaccessible cardinal assumptions,
and the famous work of Cohen suggests that there’s no natural model of \(ZF +\)¬\(C\)– in addition to the fact that any \(V_α\) should satisfy choice.</p>

<p>Okay the reasoning in the last paragraph is all backwards, so let’s cap it there.</p>

<p>I forgot to write that the notion <em>natural model</em> appears to be due to Montague.
I can’t seem to find this mentioned in Enderton anymore,
but another Montague fun fact.
At least I usually call it “Montague’s notion of natural model”.</p>

<p>Hence my confusion with Awodey’s reuse of the term.</p>

and since it seems I’d forgotten about it after the first time,
I’m making a note here.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I’m using nix, as installed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code> (on debian).
And thunderbird<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is installed by nix,
to get the daily release<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I’m using using the <a href="https://github.com/Frederick888/external-editor-revived">external-editor-revived</a>
plugin so I can write emails in vim.
The setup turns out to be a bit finicky with nix though.</p>

<h2 id="issue">Issue</h2>
<p>After <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nix profile upgrade '.*'</code> ing thunderbird,
when I try to use the external editor,
I get the following errors<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> as some sort of floating X11 dialog/notification box:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gvim: /nix/store/…/libc.so.6: version ‘GLIBC_2.38’ not found
(required by /nix/store/…-libcap-2.69-lib/lib/libcap.so.2).</p>

  <p>gvim: /nix/store/…/libc.so.6: version ‘GLIBC_2.38’ not found
(required by /nix/store/…-libtool-2.4.7-lib/lib/libltdl.so.7).</p>

  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the external editor doesn’t fire up.</p>

<p>My <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ldd --version</code> on my host debian system
shows glibc version 2.37.</p>

<p>Note that gvim is installed through apt,
on the host system (the “optiplex780” which is actually a hp z2 mini g3).
A similar error happens on the T130
when using konsole and vim,
where konsole is installed with nix.</p>

<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<p>I’m embarrassed to say I still can’t make heads or tails of how nix works,
much as I’ve tried.
So I don’t know exactly why some part of the process wants the host system to have
what’s presumably the glibc version used to build thunderbird.</p>

<p>I hope eventually I’ll figure this one out,
but the workaround I can live with for now is just to either</p>

<ol>
  <li>not upgrade thunderbird too much (rollback if it uses a glibc version I don’t have yet)</li>
  <li>temporarily live w/o a working external-editor until the debian glibc version catches up (which is iirc what I did the last time this happened). And then 1.</li>

<p>I had all the configuration files in <a href="https://github.com/hejohns/.rc">my rc github repo</a>,
but I didn’t document what to actually do, so here we go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a fresh debian container
    <ul>
      <li>You probably want to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adduser hejohns</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt install sudo</code> and  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adduser hejohns sudo</code>
  since we want to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -X</code> into this box later<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Install ghc/cabal w/ ghcup
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/">https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/</a></li>
      <li>Install the required system packages (eg curl, libffi-dev, libgmp-dev, …)</li>
      <li>Do their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl | sh</code> thing</li>
      <li>If this container is just for xmonad, can do a minimal ghcup install</li>
      <li>Can probably just use the default version of ghc.
  You can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ghcup tui</code> to install something newer, but if you pick something too bleeding edge, you might get cabal package constraint errors later</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Install xmonad
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html">https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html</a></li>
      <li>Install the required system dependencies (eg libx11-dev, libxss-dev, …)</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cabal update</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cabal install --lib xmonad xmonad-contrib</code>
  for the libraries xmonad needs on recompile</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cabal install xmonad</code> for the actual executable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You still need some X infrastructure for xmonad to work
    <ul>
      <li>At the least, you need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt install x11-utils</code> or else xmonad will error out on some missing executable</li>
      <li>This might be included in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt install xorg</code></li>
      <li>I don’t know anything about X,
  so I don’t even know if you need an X server or not–
  but I think it didn’t work until I installed one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I’m lazy, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xmonad --recompile</code> and wait for it to error out b/c of the missing <em>xmonad.hs</em></li>
  <li>This creates <em>~/.config/xmonad</em> for you (for create it yourself)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone</code> the rc repo or equivalent
(for <em>xmonad.hs</em>, <em>.xsession</em>, and associated systemd files)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> the <em>xmonad.hs</em> into <em>~/.config/xmonad</em></li>
  <li>Confirm that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xmonad --recompile</code> works now</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xmonad --replace</code> won’t work yet since the X env isn’t setup properly</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> the systemd files in rc under <em>etc/systemd/user</em> to their respective place in the actual system</li>
  <li>You probably need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemctl --user enable</code> the two services</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code> the <em>xsession</em> into <em>~/.xsession</em></li>
  <li>Finally add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(bash ~/.xsession &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;)</code> or equivalent to your <em>.bashrc</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Now, when you’re on your desktop, you can <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -X</code> into this box we just setup
and when the bashrc gets sourced on login,
the xsession file will also run and start the systemd user target to fire up
xmonad and xcompmgr.</p>

<p>Oh right, so you probably want to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcompmgr</code> as well.
The systemd file in the repo currently assumes it was installed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nix</code>,
but you can just install it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code> and change the path.
(I did that just now.)</p>

<p>My desktop is a “dumb” client
(actually, it’s a minimally configured debian + xfce install),
so I can outsource the ghc and xmonad mess to another machine this way.</p>

<p>Why the fuss with systemd?
xmonad used to segfault all the time for some reason,
and having your (remote) window manager suddenly stop really sucks.
A systemd user service that automatically restarts seemed like the right solution.
(When xmonad restarts, all the tilings get reset, but at least a window manager is still running.)</p>

<p>Actually, I don’t think I’ve had xmonad segfault in a long time now,
but the principle stands.</p>

<p>One thing I hadn’t gotten around to was setting up <a href="https://github.com/icecc/icecream">icecc</a>,

I thought I’d have to write systemd services for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iceccd -d</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">icecc-scheduler -d</code> myself,
  but the debian package for icecc already does it for you<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>,

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt install icecc</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemctl enable icecc-scheduler</code></li>
</ul>

<p>From what I can tell, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iceccd</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">icecc-scheduler</code> automagically form a local (sub)network-wide cluster, which can be viewed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">icecream-sundae</code>.</p>

<p>And of course, as the icecc README says, clients of the cluster need to
